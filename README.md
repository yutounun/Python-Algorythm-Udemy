# 🚀 Algorithms and Problem-Solving Repository

## Overview 📖

This repository serves as my personal journey through the world of algorithms and data structures. It's a chronicle of my learning process, where I tackle various algorithmic problems and document my solutions.

## Learning Resources 📚

My primary resource for learning and practicing algorithms is the online course [Python Data Structures & Algorithms + LEETCODE Exercises](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-structures-algorithms-python/). This course offers a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing data structures and algorithms using Python.

## Objectives 🎯

- **Learning and Improving**: Deepening my understanding of algorithms and data structures.
- **Problem Solving**: Regularly solving problems to apply theoretical knowledge practically.
- **Sharing Knowledge**: Documenting my learning process and solutions for others to learn from.

## Repository Structure 📂

Each directory or file in this repository represents a specific concept or a set of problems I've worked on. The typical structure includes:

- **Algorithm Implementation**: Code snippets implementing various algorithms 🧩.
- **Solved Problems**: Solutions to problems, primarily from the LEETCODE exercises linked with the course 🧑‍💻.
- **Notes and Resources**: Personal notes or additional resources I've used for learning 📝.

## How to Navigate 🧭

- **By Topic**: The repository is organized into directories based on topics like sorting algorithms, data structures, etc.
- **By Complexity**: Problems and solutions are organized by their complexity, from basic to advanced.
- **By Course Structure**: Aligning with the structure of the course for those who are following the same material.
